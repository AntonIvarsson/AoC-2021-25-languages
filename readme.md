# AoC-2021-25-languages

The idea here is to do every day of the Advent of Code 2021 in a new programming language. This is problaby a bad idea.

The rule is that if a task is written in a language and then re-written in something else, the first language is _reclaimed_ and can be used again.

#### Used languages
* Day1: F#
* Day2: Bash
* Day3: Python
* Day4: c++
* Day5: Ruby
